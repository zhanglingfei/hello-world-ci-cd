● Cloud Provider - GCP (***DONE***)

● Web Application - Take an existing open-source web application project including frontend, backend, and database. （UPDATE: ***create a open-source NodeJS web application***)

● Infrastructure as Code - Use tools like Terraform to host the application in the cloud. <br>
 ***Feedback***:
Terraform is primarily an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool designed for managing and provisioning cloud resources, not for directly hosting applications. It excels at creating and configuring infrastructure components like virtual machines, networks, and storage, which are necessary for running applications. However, Terraform does not handle the actual deployment or runtime management of applications themselves.<br>
For application hosting, tools like Kubernetes, Docker, or platform-specific services are typically used in conjunction with the infrastructure Terraform sets up. Terraform creates the environment where applications can be hosted, but it doesn't manage the application lifecycle directly.

● Continuous Integration - Create a CI pipeline using GitHub actions (preferred but you can use others as well), and the required stages that you think would add value. (***DONE***)<br>
● Docker - Create a docker image from the CI. (***DONE***)<br>
● Continuous Deployment - Automate the deployment process using Kubernetes. Include deployment to minimize downtime and risk. (***DONE***)<br>
● Monitoring and logging - Integrate monitoring and logging solutions to collect logs from infrastructure and applications. Describe how you can use these tools for detecting and troubleshooting issues. <br>
***Feedback***:
For monitoring and logging on Google Cloud Platform, I would leverage GCP's native Cloud Operations suite (formerly Stackdriver). This integrated solution provides comprehensive observability for both GCP services and custom applications.

● Documentation/readme.md (***DONE***) 

● The assignment needs to be done with the release to production mindset. （UPDATE)
***Feedback***: <br>
Implementing all aspects of a production mindset in an interview setting would be impractical and overly time-consuming. Here's a consolidated, more realistic set of guidelines as ***paper solution*** that balance demonstrating production-readiness knowledge with practical implementation for an interview scenario:

***1. Core Development Practices:***
   - Implement basic linting and code formatting (e.g., ESLint, Prettier)
   - Write unit tests for critical functions
   - Set up a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions

***2. Deployment Strategy:***
   - Use a basic branching strategy (e.g., feature branches and main)
   - Implement a straightforward deployment to GKE
   - Mention the concept of environment separation (dev/staging/prod)

***3. Security Essentials:***
   - Use environment variables or secrets management for sensitive data
   - Implement basic authentication for the application
   - Mention the importance of regular security updates

***4. Monitoring and Logging:***
   - Implement basic application logging
   - Set up error tracking (e.g., console.error for critical issues)
   - Discuss the importance of centralized logging and monitoring

***5. Infrastructure as Code:***
   - Use Kubernetes YAML files for defining deployments and services
   - Store these configuration files in version control

***6. Documentation:***
   - Provide a clear README.md with setup and run instructions
   - Include basic API documentation if applicable

***7. Performance Considerations:***
   - Set resource requests and limits in Kubernetes deployments
   - Mention the concept of auto-scaling for handling variable loads

***8. Disaster Recovery:***
   - Discuss the importance of data backups and a basic recovery plan

For an interview setting, implement these core elements to demo the solution on paper in project and be prepared to discuss other production considerations. Explain that while a full production setup would include more comprehensive measures, these key points demonstrate the understanding of production-readiness without overcomplicating the interview project.
Remember to emphasize that in a real job scenario, you would work with the team to implement a more comprehensive set of production practices tailored to the specific needs and scale of the project.
